## How to use

First Step: You need to clone this repo with:

```
git clone https:https://github.com/gabriel-brito/quick-react-start
```

Second Step: you install all the dependencies with:

```
cd quick-react-start
npm i
```

>Note: You need install Webpack on your computer with *npm install -g webpack* to run the command


Ok! Now you have a complete structure with ReactJs, Webpack and Sass!

To use Sass on your project, you need to import your .scss or your .sass file on *"/assets/style.scss"* and run the *sass --watch style.scss:style.css* comand to make your CSS file.

After all the changes in your project, write *webpack* on your command line. Your project will be compiled and refreshed with all the changes.
